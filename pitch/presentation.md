## Bootstrap Usage

Bootstrap was used to:

## Custom CSS

Custom CSS was added to:

* Define the color palette (blush pink and neutral tones) 
* Select and combine serif and sans-serif fonts  
* Create hover effects and transitions 
* Maintain visual coherence with the brand identity  

```css
.btn-outline-pink:hover {
  background-color: #c08f8f;
  color: white;
}
```

## JavaScript Features

JavaScript was used to add interactivity:

* Active navigation links while scrolling 
* Expandable class cards on click
* Cookie consent banner

## Social Media Strategy

The studio could develop an online presence through:

## Why Reveal.js?

Reveal.js allowed me to:

The website represents a solid starting point for a real Pilates studio and reflects the objectives of the Web Communication course.
